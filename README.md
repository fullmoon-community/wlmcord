# What happened to WLMcord?
A recent change in Discord's API has made WLMcord inoperable regardless of the version. And in addition to that, **a rewrite in C++ is being worked on.** Since a new version is coming soon and it makes no sense to make people use a broken version, I took everything down. I will push the rewrite once it's done though!
